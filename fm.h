	/** The Hardware Configuration should be written to config.h
		The driver expects the following preprocessor defines to be present in the file
		
	FM_RESET - the pin that the reset is connected to
	FM_PORTRESET - the port of the above pin
	FM_DDRRESET - the DDR of the above pin
	FM_SDIO  - the pin where the sdio is connected to
	FM_PORTSDIO - the port of the above pin
	FM_DDRSDIO - the DDR of the above pin

	The following defines are required by i2c.c. Have a look at it for more information
	TW_DDR, TW_PIN, TW_PORT, TW_SCK, TW_SDA

	The ports that the radio is connected to don't need to be pre-initialized, the fm_turn_on function will do that for you.
